# App Drawer: Departmentalized Organization

The App Drawer is built to kill "infinite scroll" fatigue by sorting your apps into departments instead of one long alphabetical list.

##  Departmental Logic

Every installed app is auto-assigned to a department. The built-in set:
- **COMM** — messaging, calling, and email apps
- **SOCIAL** — social networks
- **PRODUCTIVITY** — office, notes, and utility tools
- **TOOLS** — system utilities and calculators
- **PHOTO** — camera and gallery apps
- **FINANCE** — banking and finance apps
- **SHOPPING** — retail and marketplace apps
- **GAMING** — games
- **NEWS** — news and reading apps
- **OTHER** — anything that doesn't match a keyword

You can rename, reorder, and create your own departments from **Engineering → APPS**.

##  Intelligent Automation (Keyword Sort)

You don't have to manually move apps.
1. Go to **Engineering → APPS**.
2. Tap a department, edit its **Keywords** (e.g. add "bank" to FINANCE, "pubg" to GAMING).
3. The launcher scans every installed app and auto-sorts anything matching those keywords — new installs are classified the same way, automatically.

##  Hidden Apps

- **Soft-Hide:** Long-press any app in the drawer and choose **Hide from Drawer**. The app stays installed, it just stops cluttering your tabs.
- **Managing Hidden Apps:** Go to **Engineering → APPS → HIDDEN APPS** to review and restore anything you've hidden.

##  Browsing Features

- **Fast Scroll:** Use the alphabet rail on the right to jump straight to a letter.
- **Recently Used / Recently Installed:** Quick-access rows surface your most-used and newest apps without hunting through departments.
- **List vs. Grid view:** Switch between a name-first list and an icon-first grid from the drawer's view toggle — pick whichever reads faster for you.
- **Icon Packs:** Apply an installed icon pack across the drawer and your home cards from **Engineering → APPEARANCE → ICON PACK**.

##  Technical Note
The drawer loads apps through an asynchronous, reactive data stream, so even a 500+ app library stays scrollable and searchable without a hitch — and it live-updates the moment you install, uninstall, or update anything, no manual refresh needed.

## v4.15–v4.18.1 Drawer Updates

The safe-area-aware header is now a single focused row: search, a one-tap list/grid switch, and **Apps** settings. System Back dismisses the drawer, and flinging past the top of either the grid or list closes it as well.

Create a department directly from the end of the department collection without leaving the drawer. The quick flow validates duplicate names and supports optional keywords plus color presets. Package lookups and grouped results are cached while the persisted department list stays live, so filtering and department changes need fewer rescans; pinned apps still lead list view. The alphabet index dock no longer flickers when a finger rests at a letter-bucket boundary.
