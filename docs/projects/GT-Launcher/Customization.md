# Customization: Deep Dive into the Grid Engine & Card Builder

##  How the Grid Works

The launcher divides your screen into a matrix.
- **Columns (X):** Configurable from 2 to 12 — default **6** (**Engineering → HOME → GRID ENGINE**).
- **Rows (Y):** Not a fixed count. The grid simply grows to fit however many cards you place — there's no rows setting to configure.
- **Cell Height:** Set by **Grid Cell Size**, 32–80dp, default **44dp**.

### The "Snap-to-Grid" Logic
When you drag a card, the engine (`GridEngine.kt`) tracks the nearest free cell live and scores nearby candidate positions by how much they'd disturb your existing layout — that's the ghost-preview you see while dragging. On drop, if the target cell is occupied, GT-Launcher **cascades the blocking card(s) downward** to make room rather than rejecting the move outright. A gravity pass then settles everything so nothing floats over empty rows.

Each card's minimum size is enforced per capability (e.g. a Gallery card can't shrink below the size it needs to show art) — the resize handle simply won't let you go smaller.

## Capability-Based Card Builder

GT-Launcher uses a **Unified Card Capability System (UCCS)**. Cards are not a fixed type — they're a surface that can host one or more capabilities simultaneously.

### Creating a Card
Enter **Edit Mode**, then tap **ADD**. The current builder is a searchable, group-filterable list with a live preview of the actual card; selecting **Add** places it immediately with sensible defaults. Configure its icon, color, bindings, dimensions, visual style, and modules later in Card Settings, which provides Appearance, Layout, Modules, and Module Settings tabs plus a live card preview.

### Capability Catalog

The FUNCTION tab's module picker lists every capability the launcher supports — nothing is hidden, though incompatible combinations are greyed out with an on-screen reason instead of blocked silently.

| Group | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **PRIMARY** | Widget · Gallery · Media Control · App Drawer · Clock · Weather · Finance |
| **COMMUNICATION** | Notifications · Comms |
| **ACTION** | App Launch · Camera · Flashlight |
| **UTILITY** | System Stats · Spacer · Deck · Calendar · Timer · Note · Step Counter |

The current catalog also includes **Calculator**, **Water Intake**, **Focus Timer**, **Voice Memo**, **Quick Toggles**, **Favorite Contacts**, and **Gesture Input**. Water Intake supports editable serving presets. The Add Module catalog follows the same searchable/filterable, live-preview flow as Add Card.

**Compatibility rules:** capabilities within the same conflict set can't stack on one card — e.g. two `PRIMARY` capabilities that both claim the card's main surface (Widget + Gallery, say) will grey each other out. Stacking a *second* capability onto any card (e.g. App Launch + Notifications badge) and the **Finance** capability are both Premium features.

### Camera Capability Modes
When you add a **Camera** capability you can set its launch mode directly in the builder:
`PHOTO` · `VIDEO` · `SELFIE` · `PORTRAIT` · `PANORAMA` · `SLO-MO` · `NIGHT` · `PRO`

![Picking camera capability launch modes](assets/customization/camera-mode-picker.gif)

### Widget Capability
When a Widget capability is present, the builder's action button becomes **SELECT WIDGET →** and launches the system's Android widget picker directly.

### Gallery & Image Logs Capability
Display custom photos, wallpapers, and albums directly inside cards. In Card Builder or Card Settings, tap **SELECT →** to pick images from your device storage.

### Finance Capability (Premium)
Track stock, crypto, and FX holdings on a single card with live quotes and running profit/loss. GT-Launcher never asks for a brokerage login — it only reads public price feeds. The card's P&L text automatically checks for color clashes against the card's own accent/background: if the profit-green or loss-red would blend into the card's background, it falls back to the normal text color instead of rendering unreadable green-on-green or red-on-red.

##  Visual Styles System

Apply a global card rendering style from **Engineering → APPEARANCE → CARD STYLE**. Each style has its own set of adjustable parameters, and every card can override the global style individually.

![Switching Visual Style: Flat → Glass → Neobrutalism → Claymorphism](assets/customization/visual-style-switch.gif)

### Available Styles

| Style | Character | Adjustable Params |
|---|---|---|
| **FLAT** | Solid fill, subtle border | Corner radius, BG alpha, Border alpha |
| **GLASS** | Frosted translucent surface | Corner radius, BG alpha, Border alpha |
| **NEO** (Neobrutalism) | Hard shadow offset, retro feel | Corner radius, BG alpha, Border width, Shadow size, Shadow direction (TL/TR/BL/BR), Shadow color mode |
| **CLAY** (Claymorphism) | Soft pastel blob with elevation | Corner radius, BG alpha, Elevation |
| **MINIMAL** | Near-invisible, text-only | Border weight only |
| **NEON** | Glowing outline on a dark surface | Corner radius, Glow radius, Glow color |

**Shadow Direction** (NEO only): `TL` `TR` `BL` `BR` — picks which corner casts the hard shadow.
**Shadow Color Mode** (NEO only): `CONTRAST_BG` (auto contrast), `ACCENT` (theme color), `DARK`.

Per-card style override is available in **Card Settings → VISUAL**.

### Style Gallery

Each style applied to the same home screen layout, side by side:

##  Theme Engine & Color System

### Theme Hierarchy
1. **Global Preset:** 12 named color palettes — `ORANGE` (Classic TNG Style) · `BLUE` (Calm & Professional) · `GREEN` (Fresh & Natural) · `PURPLE` (Mysterious & Royal) · `RED` (Bold & Alert) · `TEAL` (Calm & Scientific) · `NAVY` (Deep & Elegant) · `MAGENTA` (High-Tech & Bold) · `ROSE` (Warm & Elegant, TOS Pink) · `CYAN` (Sharp & Electric, Borg/Tactical) · `YELLOW` (Bright & Optimistic) · `AMBER` (Warm & Timeless, TOS Gold). The parenthetical is flavor-text shown right under each preset's name in the picker, not a separate name.
2. **Smart Presets:** `GLASS` (premium glassmorphism gradients) and `PORTAL` (Aperture Science — orange & blue), both browsable alongside the 12 standard presets.
3. **Adaptive Themes (optional, opt-in):** three live-updating automation strategies — Hourly, Battery Level, and Weather Based — see below. Only one can be active at a time, and switching back to manual restores your last hand-picked palette.

![Browsing theme presets](assets/customization/theme-creator-presets.gif)

### Adaptive (Dynamic) Themes
Beyond the 12 static presets, three strategies keep the palette live instead of fixed:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Hourly Auto Theme** | Shifts hue across the day on its own schedule — no manual switching needed. |
| **Battery Level** | Recolors the whole UI by charge: green above 80%, sliding through teal, yellow, and orange down to red at 15% or below. Purely a passive color choice — it does not raise any alert or popup. |
| **Weather Based** | Recolors based on the live weather condition (e.g. a blue tint for rain). |

Only one strategy runs at a time — enabling one automatically disables the others.

![Toggling Hourly and Battery adaptive themes live](assets/customization/dynamic-theme-toggle.gif)

### Theme Creator (v4.4+)
Access via **Engineering → APPEARANCE → THEME CREATOR**.
- **HSV Color Wheel:** Outer ring = hue (0–360°), inner square = saturation/value. Canvas-based, drag or tap.
- **Color Harmony Engine:** 5 auto-palette suggestions from your chosen color: Complementary, Analogous, Triadic, Split, Tetradic.
- **Live Preview:** Simulated header + card grid with your Primary/Secondary/Tertiary colors.
- **14 Presets:** Horizontal chip row; tapping jumps the wheel to that color.
- **Hex Entry + Brightness Slider:** Direct `#RRGGBB` input.

Non-default Visual Styles inside the Theme Creator are a Premium feature.

### Per-Card Color Override (v4.4+)
Every card can carry its own independent accent color.
- Open **Card Settings → CARD COLOR**.
- Enter a `#RRGGBB` hex or pick from the 9 quick-chips.
- Tap `` to revert to the global theme rotation.
- `null` = theme-following (default).

![Overriding individual card color with HSV wheel & harmonies](assets/customization/card-color-override.gif)

Custom accents automatically pick black or white text for contrast, the same clash-avoidance logic the Finance card uses for its P&L numbers.

---

##  Header Widget System (v4.4+)

Configure the top header area in **Engineering → HOME → HEADER WIDGETS** (or tap ** HEADER** while in edit mode on the home screen).

![Configuring header widgets, sizing and visibility](assets/customization/header-widget-editor.gif)

### Widget Types
`TITLE` · `CLOCK` · `DATE` · `DATE_SHORT` · `WEATHER` · `BATTERY` · `STARDATE`

### Per-Widget Controls
- **Size:** XS / S / M / L / XL
- **Visibility toggle:** show/hide individually
- **↑↓ Reorder** within the column
- **Left / Right column** configured independently

The header height auto-adjusts to widget content — there's no fixed height.
- Tap the **Clock** widget → opens Alarm.
- Tap the **Date** widget → opens Calendar.

---

##  Layout Profiles (Presets)

Save the whole card arrangement as a named "Station" in **Engineering → SYSTEM → LAYOUT PRESETS**, and switch between them any time — one tap loads a completely different card set, colors, and positions. Useful for keeping, say, a dense daily-driver layout and a stripped-down minimal one side by side.

![Saving and switching layout presets & profile backups](assets/customization/layout-presets.gif)

##  Wallpaper & Background Images

Set a full launcher wallpaper or custom background overlay behind your card grid:
- Navigate to **Engineering → HOME → BACKGROUND**.
- Tap **SELECT BACKGROUND** (or **FOREGROUND IMAGE**).
- Tap **SELECT IMAGE** to open the system file picker and choose any photo.
- Pinch and drag to align the crop in the live preview, then tap **SAVE BACKGROUND**.

##  Performance Tip

On older devices, a larger cell size or fewer columns means fewer Compose nodes on screen and smoother animations — try dropping to 4-5 columns or bumping the cell size before reaching for a lower-end theme. GT-Launcher also auto-requests the device's highest supported refresh rate (90/120/144 Hz) via `preferredDisplayModeId`.

## Current Builder, Gestures, and Style Controls (v4.15–v4.18.1)

The current **Add Card** flow is a single searchable, group-filterable catalog with a live preview of the actual card. Choosing **Add** places a sensibly configured card immediately; detailed icon, color, action, size, and module changes belong in Card Settings rather than a second setup form. The equivalent Add Module catalog uses the same searchable/filterable pattern and previews cards at their natural grid geometry.

New standalone card choices are **Calculator**, **Water Intake**, **Focus Timer**, **Voice Memo**, **Quick Toggles**, and **Favorite Contacts**. Water Intake's preset amounts are editable. Content-heavy cards now have enforced minimum dimensions, including on layouts created before the rule existed.

**Gesture Input** is available as a card capability. Press, hold, and draw one of ten supported single-stroke shapes to run its bound action; it can be the only content on a card or an add-on to another compatible card. The test toast reports the recognized shape and confidence, and the stroke defaults to the card's readable text color unless you choose one.

Card Settings now has clearer Appearance, Layout, Modules, and Module Settings tabs plus a live preview of the real card. A card can override the global visual style in its own settings. Style Studio is no longer a separate dialog: it lives in Settings, and dragging a color, shadow, or corner slider reveals the live home screen underneath. The radial long-press menu can be either a circle or an independent 3–12-sided regular polygon; its side count does not depend on the number of actions.

Saved profiles are now managed in one always-visible Settings block: enter a name and save, then tap any listed saved profile to load it. This replaces the separate save dialog and profile-browser flow.
